    "text": "Visualization\nSemaglutide seems to be linked to a lower risk of being diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease compared to several other diabetes medications. This was seen in people with type 2 diabetes, a group already known to have a higher risk of Alzheimer’s. The benefit wasn’t just in comparison to insulin, which is often associated with cognitive decline, but also when semaglutide was compared to commonly used non-insulin drugs like metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors, and even other GLP-1 receptor agonists.\nThe difference was especially large when comparing semaglutide to insulin and sulfonylureas, with over 60% relative risk reduction in Alzheimer’s diagnosis. That might reflect the harmful effects of those drugs on the brain, especially insulin, which can cause low blood sugar episodes. But the fact that semaglutide also outperformed metformin, a drug sometimes thought to have cognitive benefits, makes the case even stronger.\nWhat stands out is that semaglutide did better than older GLP-1RAs too. That suggests the effect isn’t just about the drug class, but something specific to semaglutide—possibly how it works in the brain, its stronger overall effects, or how long it stays active in the body.\nAltogether, this real-world evidence points to semaglutide offering more than just blood sugar control. It may also help reduce the risk of Alzheimer and dementia in people with type 2 diabetes. It’s not proof of prevention, but it’s a strong signal that deserves more research in future clinical trials."
